                     <p>Let me start by saying that I have never been a fan of reality TV shows. They are so over the top and dramatic, it is nowhere near convincing. <i>Surely, people don't actually act that way in real life?</i>  </p>
                     <p class= "bold"> <b>Turns out they do!</b> </p>
                     <p>In the summer of 2021 I took a trip to North Carolina with my sister and some of her friends. I want you to notice how I said ‚Äúher friends‚Äù because they definitely do not belong to me, I just tagged along so I could stay in a sweet beach house (and hopefully meet some beach hotties.)</p>

                     <p>The story starts with my sister, Tena, and I landing in a tiny airport in North Carolina. We were there to see her friend, Erica, who had moved to North Carolina a couple years ago. Erica‚Äôs brother, Mitch, who my sister nicknamed ‚ÄúMitch the B*tch‚Äù immediately upon meeting him, was also flying in to visit. We landed about the same time as Mitch, so the three of us met up to Uber together to the beach house. I could sense trouble the second I saw my sister lay eyes on Mitch. </p>
                     <p class= "bold"><b>She wanted him. And when Tena wants something, she doesn‚Äôt stop until she gets it. </b></p>

                     <p>When we arrived at the beach house, Erica, her kids and husband, and Tena‚Äôs other friend, Brittany, were already there making lunch. I was dying to hit the beach, but Tena wanted to go with Mitch to the liquor store, so I stayed behind with Brittany and Erica. That was a mistake. Brittany and Erica had apparently been fighting all day, and didn‚Äôt stop on my account. After 10 minutes of watching a screaming match between two people who weren‚Äôt my friends, I did what any reasonable person would have done, I slowly backed my way out the door and walked my happy a** down to the beach! I came on this trip to chill in the sand, not awkwardly stand in the corner while people I barely know scream at each other. </p>
                     <p id= "separate">The beach was wonderful! I sat on the shoreline and let the tides gently push me forwards and backwards, finally at peace. Too soon I heard someone SCREAMING my name. My sister ran up to me, tears in her eyes, absolutely livid with me for leaving without telling anyone. Apparently I could have gotten lost or been ‚Äúabducted and no one would have known where I‚Äôd gone off to.‚Äù üôÑ What did she expect me to do, interrupt the screaming match to say, ‚ÄúHey girls, this is super awkward so I‚Äôm gonna hit the beach?‚Äù In hindsight, I should have sent her a text, but I was just excited to get my toes in the sand.</p>

                     <p id= "separate" >We ate a quick breakfast together and (with the whole gang this time) made our way down to the beach. We had an absolute blast. Body surfing, building sandcastles with the kiddos, we even got to watch a bunch of sea turtles hatch! It was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen! After that everything was kind of a blur because I drank too many gin & tonics and passed out under the umbrella. Whoops. </p>

                     <p>At this point in the trip Tena and Mitch are really hitting it off. I can tell they‚Äôre into each other, and unfortunately, so can her friend Brittany. A little backstory here, Brittany used to hook up with Mitch many years ago and apparently was ‚Äúconsidering leaving her wealthy boyfriend of 11 years for him.‚Äù I say this loosely because I believe that is a downright lie. Brittany has a child with her boyfriend and has been cheating on him with countless men for years, why would she leave all that behind for a man who lives 4 hours away from her? I can tell Brittany is getting a little jealous but I don‚Äôt think much of it. As soon as we get back to the beach house, all hell breaks loose. </p>

                     <p>The beach house has a little shed with a shower in it so you can get all the sand off before you go inside. I quickly rinsed myself off and let my sister have it. I didn‚Äôt see Mitch walk in after her‚Ä¶but Brittany did. Nosey Brittany snuck into the shed and watched the whole thing without them realizing it. As soon as Tena and Mitch walked in the house, Brittany exploded. Completely lost it. Phrases like, ‚ÄúHOW DARE YOU‚Äù, ‚ÄúTHOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIEND‚Äù, ‚ÄúYOU BROKE GIRL CODE‚Äù, ‚ÄúI WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU‚Äù permeated through my closed bedroom door. I had no interest in getting involved, but my sister needed me. Do I think Tena broke girl code? Yeah, kind of. Do I care? No, not even a little bit. Brittany is the worst. <i>What kind of person spies on two people in the shower?</i> After a few hours of dealing with an angry Brittany and a crying Tena, Brittany (thankfully) decided to get a hotel room and leave early. I can gladly say the trip was 100% better after she left, we had a great time without her.</p>

                     <p>I didn‚Äôt see Brittany again until a couple months later. We had already planned a trip to Hermann, MO way before the North Carolina fiasco, and we didn‚Äôt want to waste the money we already spent on it. It was a huge mistake, Brittany was still angry and it was basically North Carolina all over again. That‚Äôs two vacations in a row where she made me feel like I was on a bad episode of The Real World meets Jersey Shore. I haven‚Äôt seen her since, and I don‚Äôt plan to. </p>
